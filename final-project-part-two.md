# Identified changes for Part III
After analyzing the interview findings, it's evident that there are notable differences in the understanding and perspectives of the interviewees regarding the copper industry in Chile and its polivy implications. Here are the observations:

1. Limited Knowledge on Current State: While Audience B demonstrated a moderate understanding based on recent news articles and market trends, both Audience A and Audience C showed varying degrees of unfamiliarity with the current state of the copper industry in Chile.

2. Understanding of Economic Impact: Audience B had a clear understanding of the significant contribution of copper exports to Chile's GDP, whereas Audience A and Audience C had limited awareness of the specific percentage and implications.

3. Challenges and Vulnerabilities: All audiences recognized the vulnerability associated with over-reliance on copper exports, but Audience A provided more detailed insights into the potential risks, including fluctuations in global demand and prices.

4. Correlation with OPEC Policies: None of the audiences fully grasped the correlation between OPEC policies and potential recommendations for Chile, indicating a need for clearer explanations or analogies.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unfamiliarity with the current state of the copper industry in Chile | To address the varying levels of understanding among the interviewees, I plan to provide more context and background information on the copper industry in Chile in Part III. This will include a brief overview of the current state of the industry, its historical significance, and recent trends to ensure that readers, regardless of their prior knowledge, have a clear understanding of the topic. |
| Limited awareness of the economic impact of copper export to Chile's GDP percentage |  For the economic impact of copper, I intend to incorporate relevant statistics and data to highlight the significance of copper exports for Chile's GDP and overall economic stability. This will provide readers with concrete information to better comprehend the implications of copper dependency on the economy.    |
| Unable to grasp the correlation between OPEC policies and potential recommendations for Chile | Regarding the correlation with OPEC policies, I will simplify the explanation and provide more straightforward analogies to help readers understand the connection between global commodity markets and potential policy implications for Chile. This will involve breaking down complex concepts into more digestible terms and drawing parallels with familiar scenarios to enhance comprehension. |

> By addressing these observations and implementing the anticipated changes, I aim to improve the coherence and effectiveness of Part III, providing readers with valuable insights and recommendations on addressing the challenges associated with Chile's reliance on copper exports.
