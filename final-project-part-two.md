Government officials and policymakers involved in economic planning and regulation.
Representatives from mining companies operating in Chile.
Economists and researchers specializing in resource economics or the Chilean economy.
Workers and communities residing in regions where copper mining is prevalent.
Environmentalists and activists concerned with the ecological impact of mining activities.
Investors and financial analysts interested in the Chilean market.
