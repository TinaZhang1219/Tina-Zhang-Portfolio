# The final data story
[Link to Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/43e4a580-c218-4020-ac60-757fa5ab5fc8/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
After I completed the first draft of the shorthand page and receiving feedback, I made the following adjustments:

### Add a graph to show the Chilean Export Breakdown by Product
Based on the feedback I received in Part II, some sudience are unfamiliar with the current state of the copper industry in Chile. To address the varying levels of understanding among the interviewees, I first indicate the percentage of export in Chile GDP, then I provide a tree map of the Export Breakdown by Product in Chile, and use brown to indiate the copper related goods.

### Add another graph to show the correlation between OPEC and crude oil price
Based on the feedback I received when interviewing a few people, it was mention multiple times that the audience are unable to grasp the correlation between OPEC policies and potential recommendations for Chile. Therefore, I add another graph that visualize the effectiveness of OPEC (Saudi Arabia, one of the OPEC member) policy on control the oil price, and provide more straightforward analogies to help readers understand the connection between global commodity markets and potential policy implications for Chile.

### Add citation to the text and sources for the embed graph
Previously, the shorthand just had a reference page, but my superscript links actually all did not work. I realized when I copied my writing from the Word document, it automatically delete all the supersciprts. So I went through and included the real citation links. Additionally, all the graph I embed from Tableau does not have source listed at the caption area, so I went back Tableau and add the sources on the graph. The credibility of the graph and my write-up increase by doing this.

### Overall Cleanup and Design Changes
My orginial draft was pretty incomplete when I sent it over to my interviewers, so I generally just did some cleanup. I added more text, rearranged some of the pages, cheng the font size of some important number or text, and included a few more design elements. Aside from the design items mentioned in the above sections, I also had to play around with the color scheme. I try to use brown-ish color background when doing analysis on copper, and use green/chile city background when giving the policy recmmendation. Iâ€™ve learned that overall, sticking to one color scheme throughout the whole site is a bit more difficult that I had expected it to be.


## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

Text here!

My audience is Chile's policymakers and Chilean citizens. 
**Chile's policymakers** I decided upon this audience because I feel that those are the two groups are either the biggest advocates and people who can make the largest impact. For example, parents are the taxpayers in this situation and can have significant influence over which policies are enforced. The legislators/school board members are the decision makers in this situation.


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
