# The final data story
[Link to Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/43e4a580-c218-4020-ac60-757fa5ab5fc8/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
After I completed the first draft of the shorthand page and receiving feedback, I made the following adjustments:

### Add a graph to show the Chilean Export Breakdown by Product
Based on the feedback I received in Part II, some sudience are unfamiliar with the current state of the copper industry in Chile. To address the varying levels of understanding among the interviewees, I first indicate the percentage of export in Chile GDP, then I provide a tree map of the Export Breakdown by Product in Chile, and use brown to indiate the copper related goods.

### Add another graph to show the correlation between OPEC and crude oil price
Based on the feedback I received when interviewing a few people, it was mention multiple times that the audience are unable to grasp the correlation between OPEC policies and potential recommendations for Chile. Therefore, I add another graph that visualize the effectiveness of OPEC (Saudi Arabia, one of the OPEC member) policy on control the oil price, and provide more straightforward analogies to help readers understand the connection between global commodity markets and potential policy implications for Chile.

### Add citation to the text and sources for the embed graph
Previously, the shorthand just had a reference page, but my superscript links actually all did not work. I realized when I copied my writing from the Word document, it automatically delete all the supersciprts. So I went through and included the real citation links. Additionally, all the graph I embed from Tableau does not have source listed at the caption area, so I went back Tableau and add the sources on the graph. The credibility of the graph and my write-up increase by doing this.

### Overall Cleanup and Design Changes (Final design decisions)
My orginial draft was pretty incomplete when I sent it over to my interviewers, so I generally just did some cleanup. I added more text, rearranged some of the pages, change the font size of some important number or text I want to emphasize, and included a few more design elements. Aside from the design items mentioned in the above sections, I also had to play around with the color scheme. I try to use brown-ish color background when doing analysis on copper, and use green/chile city background when giving the policy recmmendation. Iâ€™ve learned that overall, sticking to one color scheme throughout the whole site is a bit more difficult that I had expected it to be.

## The audience
My audience is Chile's policymakers. I decided upon Chile's policymakers because I feel that Chile's policymakers are those who can make the largest impact. For example, the policymaker work in Board of Trade or Ministry of Foreign Affair can have significant influence over which policies are enforced. The legislators/school board members are the decision makers in this situation. 

The only adjustment I made for my audience in my final project is in the presentation. When I was initially structuring what I wanted to say, I kept making too long of an introduction/overview for people not familiar with the Chilean economy, However, as Chile's policymakers and government officials, they would already know the details was and would need long introduction.

All references like information, photos, and data sources are correctly cited in shorthand.


# Final thoughts
Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project. Having prior knowledge of the data and the subject matter was beneficial as it allowed me to concentrate on tailoring the presentation for the appropriate/target audience. However, I do regret not having explored more design options for my visuals. I felt somewhat limited by my proficiency in the software and wished I could have executed my ideas more effectively. Looking ahead to the next iteration, I anticipate improving my design skills through the Tableau class, which should enable me to better articulate my concepts. Given more time, I would have liked to experiment further to bring my designs to fruition, though Tableau's complexity sometimes posed a challenge. Finally, I would have wanted to find a way to connect the shorthand page with my policy memo to Chile government that I wrote related to this theme and the shorthand page.
