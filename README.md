# About me
Hi, I'm Tina (her/she), second year student of MSPPM flagship. I'm a tennis and classical music enthusiast. I want to work in Consulting industry after graduation and happy to meet with anyone with same interest or anyone who want to mock case study interview with me! :)

# What I hope to learn
As I want to work in Conuslting in the future, which requires plenty of meetings with different stakeholders/clients, I want to utilize better data visualisation tools to develop dashboards or simply charts to perform data trends, patterns, and anomalies, etc. for effective communication in cross-department meetings. Below are some examples of what I want to learn:

1. Using color to better visualise data #1
2. Creating meaningful chart to better tell the stories from the data #2
3. Making beautiful and informative charts #3
