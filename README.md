# About me
Hi, I'm Tina (her/she), second year student of MSPPM flagship. I'm a tennis and classical music enthusiast. I want to work in Consulting industry after graduation and happy to meet with anyone with same interest or anyone who want to mock case study interview with me! :)

# What I hope to learn
As I want to work in Conuslting in the future, which requires plenty of meetings with different stakeholders/clients, I want to utilize better data visualisation tools to develop dashboards or simply charts to perform data trends, patterns, and anomalies, etc. for effective communication in cross-department meetings. Below are some examples of what I want to learn:

1. Using color to better visualise data
2. Creating meaningful chart to better tell the stories from the data
3. Making beautiful and informative charts

## Final project
My final project is to reveal how Chile economy is instable and vulnerable due to the strong reliant on copper export. In the end of the project I gave policy recommendations for Chilean policymakers using a case study of OPEC and crude oil. Last semester, I wrote a memo for Chilean governemnt related to this theme, but the memo had no visualizations, so I decided to use this opportunity to create visuals that supplement my findings and make this theme more approchable to different audiences.
